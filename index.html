<h1>Fitts Law right hand vs left hand</h1>
<p>For this study, I chose to test the accuracy of Fitts Law, as well as the speed and accuracy differences between a users dominant and non-dominant hand.</p>
<p> In this study Trevor Green(myself) and Jeffery Jones(My roomate) each took Jake Wobbroks Fitts law test with our right and left hand. We took the test on the same computer, and used the trackpad on my laptop as the input method.
<h2>Results</h2>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p> Our data was extremely accurate in predicting the fitts law model, the average r value of the four tests was 0.9366</p>
<p>The average error percent(right) was 0.08135 </p>
<p>The average error percent(left) was 0.07405 </p>
<p>The average speed (right) was 850.02</p>
<p>The average speed (left) was 1059.15</p>
<p>Suprisingly, Jeff and I were on average less accuratte with out non-dominant hand. I hypothesize this may be because we took the test with our dominant hand first and therefore had more practice for our non-dominant hand. Just as we expected however, our dominant hands were significantly faster at preforming the test.</p>
